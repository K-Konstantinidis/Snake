# Snake
A java project for the game Snake with a pause method.

This is a java project that creates the game Snake. After you run the "Snake" class, the game will appear to your screen. 

Where you click on the game screen, the game will start.

You can move the snake by pressing the arrow keys. While you are playing the game, if you press the space key, the game will pause. When you press it again it will resume.

The game is the original Snake version where if the snake head hits its body or the border of the screen, then it's game over. In the end screen you will see a Game Over message and the score. The score is the amount of apples you ate before losing.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
